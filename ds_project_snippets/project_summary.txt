Bocconi Data Science Challenge (2025) â€“ Group project snippet

Objective: predict hotel booking cancellations using a real-world, imbalanced dataset. Target variable: binary (canceled = 2, not canceled = 1).
Result: our group placed 2nd out of 7+ teams based on prediction accuracy on a held-out 2017 test set.

Contributions:
- initial data preprocessing and feature handling (categorical encoding, standardization)
- helped on design and implementation of LASSO logistic regression model
- interpreted key coefficients and writeup of final submission

NOTE: only selected code snippets are included here due to shared group ownership and course restrictions. Full codebase not open-sourced.
